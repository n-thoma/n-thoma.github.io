## Overview
Luminary is a story-driven forest adventure created over two semesters by a team of about 13, combining programming, art, and music to bring a magical world to life. Players control a witch traveling through a corrupted forest, solving puzzles, harvesting plants, and brewing potions to cleanse the land. As the graphics programmer, I handled all particle effects, VFX, materials, cutscenes using the Sequencer, lighting, the day/night cycle, and contributed to gameplay mechanics, player systems, and UI implementation.

## Goals / Motivation
Luminary was a year-long school project aimed at combining programming, art, and music to create an immersive, story-driven experience. I wanted to expand my skills in graphics, VFX, materials, and Unreal Engine 5 systems while collaborating with a larger, multidisciplinary team for the first time. The goal was to build a polished game with compelling visuals, engaging mechanics, and a rich, interactive world.

## Process / Development
Luminary was developed using a structured workflow to keep everyone coordinated. Programmers and artists each had advocates, and our producer, Marichris, helped keep the team organized. We held daily standup meetings and frequent collaboration sessions to discuss design and implementation. The designers guided both programmers and artists on what to create, and everyone worked together closely to bring the game world to life.

## My Contributions
As the graphics programmer for Luminary, I was responsible for all particle effects, VFX, materials, and lighting, including the night sky and day/night cycle. I created cutscenes using the Sequencer, contributed to gameplay mechanics like grid mode, and worked extensively in the player blueprint. I also implemented UI elements such as the Main Menu and the journal, and helped artists integrate their work into the game, ensuring both visuals and gameplay felt cohesive and polished.

## Results / Outcome
Luminary is currently a somewhat polished, playable game with compelling visuals, gameplay, and story, though it could use some additional refinement. The team hopes to eventually release it on Steam, but the projectâ€™s future is still undecided. Regardless, it was a rewarding year-long collaboration that showcased our ability to create a large-scale, multidisciplinary game.

## Lessons Learned
Luminary taught me how to collaborate with a larger, multidisciplinary team, including artists, designers, and musicians, for the first time. It was also my first experience using Unreal Engine 5, which helped me expand my skills in graphics, VFX, materials, lighting, cutscenes, and UI. Overall, the project strengthened my ability to work on complex systems and integrate different disciplines into a cohesive, polished game.
