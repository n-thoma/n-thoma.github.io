## Overview
Spell it Out (WIP) is a Nintendo Switch dungeon crawler developed as a school assignment using an official Nintendo Switch DevKit, the Nintendo SDK, and Joy-Con input systems. Players progress through procedurally generated dungeon rooms, defeating increasingly difficult skeleton enemies to unlock the path forward. Combat is entirely spell-based, with players casting magic by drawing gestures using either the Switch touchscreen or Joy-Cons, blending motion and touch controls into core gameplay. The project focused on console-specific development, gesture recognition, procedural level flow, and scalable enemy difficulty within a constrained academic timeline (about 4 weeks).

## Goals / Motivation
Spell it Out (WIP) was developed as a school project with the primary goal of learning how to build a game for the Nintendo Switch using the official Nintendo SDK and Joy-Con input systems. The project emphasized understanding console-specific development, including motion controls, touchscreen input, and platform constraints, while working collaboratively with a team of programmers. For me personally, it was an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with Unity and C#, deepen my understanding of input systems and gesture recognition, and learn how to design and implement gameplay features within a console-focused development pipeline.

## Process / Development
Spell it Out (WIP) was developed by a small team of four programmers using a relaxed but effective collaboration process. Most communication happened through Discord, with weekly in-person meetings every Friday to review progress, discuss challenges, and set goals for the following week. Tasks were self-assigned based on strengths and interests, allowing each team member to work independently while staying aligned on the overall vision. Despite the informal structure, everyone consistently met their goals, resulting in steady progress and a strong team collaboration experience.

## Features
- **Gesture-Based Spell Casting**: Spells are cast by drawing symbols using the Nintendo Switch touchscreen or Joy-Con motion controls, powered by a custom gesture recognition system.
- **Nintendo Switch–Specific Input Support:** Full integration with the Nintendo SDK, including Joy-Con input handling and touchscreen interaction.
- **Procedurally Generated Dungeons**: Each playthrough features a randomly generated dungeon layout, ensuring varied room progression.
- **Scaling Enemy Difficulty**: Skeleton enemies progressively increase in difficulty as the player advances deeper into the dungeon.
- **Unity & C# Gameplay Systems**: Core gameplay, combat logic, dungeon flow, and input systems were implemented in Unity using C#.
- **Team-Based Development**: Built collaboratively by a small team of programmers with shared ownership of systems and features.

## My Contributions
As a gameplay programmer, I was responsible for designing and implementing the core gameplay systems and level flow. I built all dungeon rooms and developed the level and level manager systems, including procedural dungeon generation and serialization to preserve dungeon state when transitioning into combat scenes. I implemented the combat system, handled room-based progression, and created the foundational UI screens such as the main menu, win screen, and lose screen. My work focused on ensuring smooth gameplay flow, reliable scene transitions, and a cohesive dungeon experience from start to finish.

## Results / Outcome
Spell it Out (WIP) received a 100% on the assignment and successfully met its goal of delivering a fun, playable game built for the Nintendo Switch. While the game is still far from fully polished, the core systems and gameplay loop are complete and enjoyable. With access to the Switch DevKit no longer available, development will continue on the PC version using mouse-based spell casting. The game is currently available on Itch.io, and the team plans to keep iterating on and improving the project over time.

## Lessons Learned
Spell it Out (WIP) helped me build a strong foundation in Unity and C#, while giving me hands-on experience with high-level gameplay scripting and system design. I gained practical experience implementing a simplified dungeon generation system, combat mechanics, and managing scene transitions in a real project. Working with a small team further strengthened my collaboration and communication skills. Most importantly, developing for the Nintendo Switch taught me to design within hardware constraints, from baking lighting and reducing polygon counts to making performance-conscious decisions throughout development.
