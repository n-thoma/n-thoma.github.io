## Overview
Zombie Clicker was my first solo game project at DigiPen, created in just 2–3 weeks using C and the CProcessing engine. In the game, you move your character with WASD while zombies chase you, and you must click on each zombie before it reaches you. The challenge increases as each zombie gets faster, testing the player’s reflexes and aim. This project introduced me to game programming, basic AI, and creating playable mechanics from scratch.

## Goals / Motivation
Zombie Clicker was a school project designed to help me learn the basics of game programming and working with a custom engine. As my first solo game, the goal was to build a playable, challenging experience from scratch while practicing C programming, simple AI, and gameplay mechanics. It was all about gaining hands-on experience and understanding how to turn code into a fun game.

## Tools & Technologies
- Language(s): C
- Frameworks / Engines: CProcessing (Custom-built C engine given to us)
- Other tools: Visual Studio

## Process / Development
For Zombie Clicker, I worked entirely solo over 2–3 weeks. I started by planning the core gameplay loop: moving the character and having zombies chase the player. Then I programmed the basic AI, character movement, and click detection, testing each part as I went. With no art assets, everything was represented with simple shapes like squares and circles, which allowed me to focus on programming mechanics and ensuring the gameplay felt responsive and fun.

## Features
- **Fast-Paced Reflex Gameplay**: Move your character with WASD and click on zombies before they reach you.
- **Increasing Challenge**: Each zombie gets faster, testing the player’s aim and reflexes.
- **Basic AI**: Programmed simple enemy behaviors to chase the player.

## My Contributions
I developed Zombie Clicker entirely on my own, programming the character movement, enemy AI, and click-based combat mechanics. Since it was a solo project, I handled all aspects of gameplay implementation, testing, and iteration, which gave me my first hands-on experience building a playable game from scratch.

---

## Results / Outcome
Zombie Clicker earned a passing grade, and while the game didn’t go beyond the classroom, it was well-received by the professor, who noted that it was impressive given my skill level at the time. The project gave me valuable early experience in game programming and creating playable mechanics from scratch.

## Lessons Learned
Zombie Clicker taught me the fundamentals of game programming, including character movement, basic AI, and implementing core gameplay loops. As my first solo project, I learned how to take a concept from idea to playable game, manage my time over a short development period, and iterate on mechanics to make the game fun and responsive. It laid the groundwork for more complex projects in future semesters.
