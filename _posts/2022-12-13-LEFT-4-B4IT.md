## Overview
LEFT 4 B4IT was my first team game project, created in a 5–6 week half-fall semester with two other classmates using C and the CProcessing engine. In the game, you play as an angler fish navigating darker and deeper waters, shooting beams from your light to fend off zombie fish. Between levels, players can upgrade their light, health, or speed from a pirate octopus in a sunken ship. I was responsible for programming all the enemy behaviors, gaining my first real experience in game programming and team development.

## Goals / Motivation
LEFT 4 B4IT was a school project designed to give us hands-on experience with C programming and game development in a short timeframe. As it was my first team project, I wanted to learn how to collaborate on a game, implement enemy behaviors, and get a feel for building gameplay systems from scratch. The goal was to make a fun, challenging underwater survival game while gaining foundational skills for future projects.

## Tools & Technologies
- Language(s): C
- Frameworks / Engines: CProcessing (Custom-built C engine given to us)
- Other tools: TortoiseSVN, Visual Studio

---

## Process / Development
For LEFT 4 B4IT, our team would brainstorm together on design decisions, like the types of enemies and general gameplay ideas. Once we had a plan, we split off into our individual tasks where I focused on programming all the enemy behaviors while my teammates worked on other aspects of the game. This structure allowed us to collaborate on creative decisions while making steady progress on our individual contributions.

## Features
- **Underwater Survival Gameplay**: Play as an angler fish navigating increasingly dark levels, fending off zombie fish enemies.
- **Upgradeable Abilities**: Between levels, choose to upgrade your light, health, or speed to survive deeper waters.
- **Enemy AI**: All enemy behaviors were programmed to challenge the player and create dynamic underwater combat.

## My Contributions
I was responsible for programming all the enemy behaviors in LEFT 4 B4IT, designing how the zombie fish moved, attacked, and reacted to the player. This was my first experience programming game AI and working as part of a team, giving me foundational skills in both C programming and collaborative development.

---

## Results / Outcome
LEFT 4 B4IT was a fun and rewarding project that earned us a passing grade. Given that it was an early, simple game created in a short timeframe, it didn’t go beyond the classroom, which is typical for many starter projects. Despite that, it provided valuable experience in teamwork, C programming, and designing enemy behaviors, laying the groundwork for more advanced projects later in my degree.

## Lessons Learned
LEFT 4 B4IT taught me the basics of working in a team, collaborating on design decisions, and dividing tasks efficiently. I gained my first real experience programming enemy behaviors in C, which helped me understand AI and gameplay systems. It also gave me insight into how early projects often start simple, and how foundational teamwork and coding skills set the stage for more complex games later.
