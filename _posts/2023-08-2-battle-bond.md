## Overview
Battle Bond is a top-down, co-op tank game I worked on during a summer semester with a team of four freshmen programmers. Built in C using a professor-provided engine, the game challenges two players to control a single tank (one handling movement, the other shooting) as they progress through enemy-filled levels and face a massive boss called Po!i-T0nK3RZ. I handled all the pixel art for the game and programmed all enemies and the boss, gaining early experience in game programming and design before diving into graphics and physics in later projects.

## Goals / Motivation
Battle Bond started as a school project, but I also saw it as a chance to learn how to program a full game from start to finish. As a freshman, I wanted hands-on experience with C programming, enemy AI, and level design, while also exploring pixel art and co-op gameplay mechanics. The goal was to build something fun, challenging, and polished within the short summer semester.

## Tools & Technologies
- Language(s): C
- Frameworks / Engines: Custom-built C engine given to us
- Other tools: GitHub, Visual Studio, GitHub Projects, Aseprite

## Process / Development
As the producer for Battle Bond, I coordinated our team of four freshmen programmers and kept us organized using GitHub Projects to track tasks. When we needed to plan or make decisions, we discussed everything together as a team. The process was a bit rough at times, given that we were all new to game development, but collaborating closely and iterating quickly helped us complete the game within the short summer semester.

## Features
- **Co-op Tank Gameplay**: Two players control a single tank — one handles movement, the other handles shooting — requiring teamwork to clear levels.
- **Challenging Levels & Boss**: Progress through enemy-filled levels and face a massive boss called Po!i-T0nK3RZ.
- **Controller Support**: Thanks to teammate [Rei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-anderson-bb702b1b6/), the game supports controllers with vibration feedback for a more immersive experience.
- **Custom Pixel Art**: All of the game’s pixel art was created by me using Aseprite.
- **Enemy & Boss Programming**: I programmed all enemies and the boss behavior, including attack patterns and AI logic.

## My Contributions
I contributed both creatively and technically to Battle Bond. I created all of the pixel art using Aseprite and designed all five levels for the game. On the programming side, I implemented all enemy and boss behavior, ensuring the AI and attack patterns were challenging and fun. As the producer, I also coordinated the team, keeping tasks organized and the project on track.

## Results / Outcome
For a game built in just a short summer semester, Battle Bond turned out really well. The professors loved it and suggested we submit it to the game gallery. While the game was mostly left untouched after the summer, it was well-received and people especially enjoyed the co-op gameplay. I’m considering revisiting it to polish and showcase it in the gallery, as it was a fun and rewarding project that highlighted teamwork and creative design.

## Lessons Learned
Battle Bond taught me a lot about teamwork and project management, especially in my role as producer where staying organized and keeping the team on track was key. It was also my first time creating pixel art, which gave me valuable creative experience. On the programming side, I gained hands-on practice with C, designing enemy behaviors and programming the boss, which helped build the foundation for more advanced gameplay and engine work in future projects.
