I am a dedicated student at DigiPen Institute of Technology, immersing myself in the world of video game development and computer science. Currently, I am deepening my knowledge of C++ and honing my skills through collaborative group projects. In addition to my formal education, I am also self-learning Python, expanding my programming toolkit and exploring its diverse applications. I love learning and have a deep passion for computer science.
